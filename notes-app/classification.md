# Notes App — Classification Guide

## Definition

A screenshot styled as a **recognizable Apple Notes card** (the native chrome: back arrow, undo/redo, share, ellipsis) used as the device carrying text, whether that's one standalone note, a tip, a quote, or one point within a longer sequence.

This is a **device**, not a structure. It answers "what is the text sitting inside," not "how many points are there." A single ad with one Notes-card screenshot is Notes App on its own. An ad that uses a Notes card to deliver each point of a multi-slide list is Notes App **plus** `Listicle` (see that format's classification guide), tagged as two `vf:` values.

## The one thing that must be true

There's a **screenshot with visible Apple Notes chrome** (the back arrow / undo-redo / share / ellipsis bar), not just any typed-looking text.

## Quick test

Ask: *does this look like a screenshot of an actual Apple Notes card, chrome and all?* If yes, Notes App. If it's typed text without that specific app chrome, it's a different format.

## Commonly confused with

- **Post-it:** also feels personal/unpolished, but Post-it is a handwritten sticky note or scrawl, not a typed, screenshotted Notes card.
- **Instagram Text Overlay:** native-styled text over an image, but that's Instagram's own type treatment, not Apple's Notes app chrome.
- **Listicle:** if the ad is a multi-slide sequence with one point per slide, check whether it also qualifies as `Listicle` and tag both. Notes App alone doesn't imply a list structure.

See `execution-sop.md` in this same folder for the full build rules.
