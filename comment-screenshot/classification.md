description: How to identify whether an ad should be classified/named as the Comment Screenshot visual format. Covers Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook comments, standing alone or with a reply captured in the same screenshot. Use when naming an ad (resolving the Visual Format taxonomy token) or auditing an existing ad's format tag. Distinct from execution-sop.md, which governs how to build one.

# Comment Screenshot — Classification Guide

## Definition

A static whose hero element is a **screenshotted comment left on a social media post** (Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook comment UI: username, avatar, comment text, like count, "Reply", relative timestamp). The screenshotted comment is the hook. It can **stand alone**, the comment itself doing all the work overlaid on the image, or it can include a **reply captured inside the same screenshot** (like the harrys example in the files folder). A response is not required.

## The one thing that must be true

There is a **screenshotted comment-thread UI element** as the visual hero, complete with commenter identity chrome (handle/avatar) and platform comment styling (like count, reply link, timestamp). It is a real (or real-seeming) comment on a post. It is **not** a question or comment-response sticker, and not a plain block of native-styled text.

## Quick test

Ask: *does this look like a screenshot of someone's comment on a social post?* If yes, Comment Screenshot, whether or not anyone replied to it. If the hero is a question / comment-response sticker being answered, that's `comment-response`. If it's caption/story text with no comment-thread chrome, it's something else.

## Commonly confused with

- **Comment Response:** also features social-feeling UI and often a reply, but the hero is a **question / comment-response sticker** (black bar + white question box, or the TikTok equivalent), not a screenshotted comment thread. No visible sticker element, and a real comment screenshot instead, means `comment-screenshot`, not `comment-response`.
- **Instagram Text Overlay:** uses IG's native caption/story text styling directly over an image, with no comment-thread chrome (no username/avatar/like count) at all.
- **Greenscreen:** can also feature a screenshot as evidence, but the creator is composited over it reacting live on video; Comment Screenshot is a static comment screenshot, with no reacting creator overlay required.

## What to look for as supporting signals

- Believable, non-brand-adjacent username/handle
- Casual typed register in the comment text (lowercase starts, contractions)
- Real platform comment chrome (like count, "Reply", relative timestamp)
- Optional reply captured in the same screenshot (often the brand's verified handle, as in the harrys example), but not required
