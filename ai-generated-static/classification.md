# AI Generated Static — Classification Guide

## Definition

A static that is an **obviously AI-generated image** — telltale AI artifacts, surreal or garbled rendering, dreamlike surfaces — with the message often baked into the generated image. The AI render itself is the format.

## The things that must all be true

1. **The image is AI-generated**, not a real photo or a clean designed graphic.
2. **AI artifacts are visible / embraced** (warped text, odd anatomy, uncanny surfaces).
3. **It reads as a generated scene**, frequently with copy rendered inside it.

## Quick test

Does it look like it came out of an image generator? If yes, AI Generated Static.

## Commonly confused with

- **AI-animation:** AI-generated *video/animation*, not a still.
- **Designed graphic:** clean vector/type layout, not generative.
- **Product photography:** a real photographed product.

## Signals

AI-warped lettering, extra fingers/paws, impossible textures, hyper-glossy generated scene, copy fused into the image.

Example in this folder: BarkBox AI birthday-cake image with warped lettering and copy baked in.

See `execution-sop.md` for the build rules.
