# Matching Chart — Classification Guide

## Definition

A static (usually an image) built as a **matching table**: several self-select categories listed down one side (body type, skin type, hair type, goal, personality, etc.), each mapped straight across to a **recommended product or variant**. The viewer finds the row that's them and reads across to their pick. No branching logic (that's flowchart) and no ranked argument (that's listicle).

## The things that must all be true

1. **A set of parallel self-select categories.** The viewer picks the one that's them from a list of options ("which one are you").
2. **Each category maps to a recommendation** — a product, variant, or answer, read straight across.
3. **It's a lookup/matching structure** — find yourself, read your match — not branching forks and not a sequential list building one argument.

## Quick test

Do you scan a table for your category and read across to your recommended pick, with no yes/no branches? If yes, Matching Chart.

## Commonly confused with

- **Flowchart:** branching yes/no forks with arrows that route you to an answer. If you follow forks, it's `flowchart`; if you find your row in a table, it's matching-chart.
- **Listicle:** an ordered list of points building one argument, not a category → recommendation map.
- **Us vs Them:** a two-column brand-vs-alternative comparison, not self-select category → your pick.
- **Feature-benefit-pointout:** call-outs on one hero product, not multiple categories each mapped to a different product.

## What to look for as supporting signals

- A "Which ___ are you?" / "What ___ is best for you?" headline
- A column of categories (often with little icons/illustrations) aligned to a column of products
- Arrows or aligned rows connecting each category to its match; often implies a shop action

Example in this folder: the Honeylove "What shapewear is best for you?" ad maps body types (Rectangle, Pear, Hourglass, Inverted Triangle, Apple) each to a specific style.

See `execution-sop.md` in this same folder for the full build rules.
