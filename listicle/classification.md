# Listicle — Classification Guide

## Definition

**A list of things.** That's it. Two or more discrete items presented as a list — numbered or not, in a single frame or across multiple slides. The list *is* the format.

The device that carries the list (plain overlay text, a Notes-app card, a handwritten note, icon+label rows, photo captions) is a separate dimension. A Listicle **often also carries a device-format tag** (commonly `Notes App`, but also `Post-it`, `Instagram Text Overlay`, etc.), tagged as two `vf:` values.

## The thing that must be true

There is a **list of 2+ discrete items**. Delivery doesn't matter:
- stacked in **one frame** (rows/bullets/lines), or
- across **multiple slides**, one item per slide.

Numbering is optional. Order may or may not matter. If it reads as a list of separate things, it's a Listicle.

## Quick test

Is the content a list of separate items I read through? If yes, Listicle.

## Commonly confused with

- **Feature Benefit Pointout:** also enumerates points, but they are **call-outs that point *at* specific parts of the product** (lines/arrows to features). If the list does **not** point at the product and just presents items beside/over it, it's Listicle.
- **Us Vs Them:** a two-column comparison table (brand vs. alternative), not a one-direction list.
- **Notes App:** a common device paired with a listicle — check `notes-app/classification.md` separately.

## Supporting signals

- Single-frame: a stack of bulleted/numbered lines or icon+label rows.
- Multi-slide: a cover/title slide, consistent treatment across slides, one item per slide.

Example in the files folder:

- Merit "SPF that doubles as a blur filter" — a single-frame list of four benefit rows (Blurs pores, Evens skin tone, Shields with mineral SPF, Feels like nothing) beside the product, none pointing at it

See `execution-sop.md` in this same folder for the full build rules.
