# Flowchart — Classification Guide

## Definition

An ad built as a **decision tree**: a question or entry point at the top, then **branching paths** (yes/no or option forks) connected by **arrows**, routing the viewer down the branch that matches them to a recommendation (usually a specific product or variant). The viewer "follows the arrows to their answer." Usually a static image.

## The things that must all be true

1. **There's a branching structure.** Arrows/connectors route the viewer through choices (yes/no or option forks), not a straight top-to-bottom list.
2. **It starts from a question/entry point and ends at a recommendation** on each branch.
3. **The viewer self-selects a path** — the whole point is "answer these and follow the arrows to the thing for you."

## Quick test

Do you follow arrows through forks to land on a personalized pick? If yes, Flowchart. If it's a straight list with no branching, or a table with no routing, it's something else.

## Commonly confused with

- **Listicle:** a straight, ordered list of points, one per row/slide, no branching. No forks or routing means it's a `listicle`, not a flowchart.
- **Us vs Them:** a two-column comparison of brand vs. alternative, not a branching path to a personalized recommendation.
- **Matching chart / "which one are you":** a table that maps each self-selected category straight to a recommendation, with parallel rows and no decision forks. If there's no branching, it's a matching chart, not a flowchart. (Not yet its own format in this library.)

## What to look for as supporting signals

- A question as the headline ("Is this your ___?", "Which ___ are you?")
- Yes/No labels on the branches, arrows connecting steps
- Each terminal node is a product/variant or a clear next step, ending in a CTA

Example in this folder: the Honeylove "Is this your boob shape?" ad branches through yes/no questions to the CloudEmbrace recommendation.

See `execution-sop.md` in this same folder for the full build rules.
