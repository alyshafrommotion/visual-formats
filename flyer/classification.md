# Flyer — Classification Guide

## Definition

A single printed sheet shown visibly **taped, stapled, or tacked into a real everyday space** — a hydro pole, community board, elevator wall, laundromat, storefront window, bus-stop pillar. Low-fi and handmade-feeling. The device borrows **grassroots, "a real person printed this and stuck it up" authenticity**, not the scale or spend of a paid media placement. Usually a static image; sometimes a scene with a passerby interacting with the sheet.

## The things that must all be true

1. **The brand's message is carried on a single printed sheet** (a flyer/poster), not a large-format built surface.
2. **It's physically affixed** (tape, staples, tacks) **into a real, ordinary public or semi-public space** — pole, board, wall, window.
3. **The scrappy grassroots placement is the device** — the point is that it looks handmade and stuck up by a person, not bought. If you strip the placement, the whole idea deflates.

## Quick test

Does it look like a flyer someone printed and taped up around town? Flyer. Does it look like a paid billboard, transit poster, or wall-scape? That's `ad-in-the-wild`.

## Commonly confused with

- **`ad-in-the-wild` (OOH):** a large paid-media surface (billboard, transit, building wall-scape) that borrows **scale and legitimacy**. Flyer is the opposite signal: small, non-paid-looking, grassroots. The dividing line is paid-media scale vs. handmade-sheet scrappiness.
- **`letter`:** a chunky text-block image with one headline hook and no physical staging. Flyer shows a sheet affixed in a real scene; letter fills the frame as a plain static.
- **The *inner* treatment:** the sheet itself can carry another format — a wanted/missing-poster meme, a listicle, a review. Tag that inner treatment as a **secondary** format when it's useful (e.g. `flyer + meme`). Flyer describes the outer placement.

## What to look for as supporting signals

- Tape corners, staples, or pushpins holding a sheet to a textured pole/board/wall
- Tear-off phone-number tabs; "missing," "wanted," "lost," or "free to a good home" flyer tropes
- A hand or passerby interacting with the sheet; slightly off-angle, handheld framing
- Real-space texture behind the sheet (brick, corkboard, elevator panel, glass)

Examples in the files folder:

- Loop "SUSPECT: Full Coverage Bundle" wanted-poster taped in an elevator (inner treatment: meme)
